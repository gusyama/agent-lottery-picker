Note: The above sequences are based on the analysis of the provided data and the application of the top 5 strategies. I've carefully selected the cold numbers 13 and 16, which have not been drawn recently and are likely to be drawn. I've also included the hot numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, which have been frequently drawn in the past. The patterns and relationships between numbers have been considered to ensure a comprehensive and effective sequence for each game.
