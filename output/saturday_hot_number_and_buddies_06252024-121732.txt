Based on the past 1 year of lottery results, I recommend the following combination of numbers:

Hot1: 11 (drawn 17 times) - a hot number that hasn't been drawn recently
Hot2: 25 (drawn 16 times) - a hot number that hasn't been drawn recently

Hot1bud1: 2 (drawn 19 times) - a number frequently paired with Hot1
Hot1bud2: 40 (drawn 17 times) - a number frequently paired with Hot1

Hot2bud1: 6 (drawn 16 times) - a number frequently paired with Hot2
Hot2bud2: 23 (drawn 15 times) - a number frequently paired with Hot2

The recommended combination is: 11, 25, 2, 40, 6, 23

This combination includes two hot numbers (11 and 25) that haven't been drawn recently, paired with their most frequent partners. The inclusion of less picked numbers (2 and 23) increases the chances of winning in case the more frequent numbers don't appear.
