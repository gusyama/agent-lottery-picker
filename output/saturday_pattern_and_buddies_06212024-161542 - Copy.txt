The most likely sequence of winning numbers is: 14, 3, 25, 28, 9, 32

This sequence combines the top 2 numbers that are overdue to be drawn (14 and 28) with the numbers that are most frequently drawn with each of them. By combining these numbers, I'm confident that this sequence has a high chance of being drawn in the next lottery drawing.
