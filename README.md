## 70 Percent Win

“70 Percent Win” formula when adding up lotto numbers
The below is the theory applied to 5/55 lottery (5 drawn numbers for each sequence with number from 1 to 55)
Make sure the sum of the numbers you play falls within the “70 Percent Most Probable Range of Sums.” 
Create a range with the lowest sum of all your lottery numbers as well as the highest sum, 
Then choose combos of lottery numbers within that range. 
Consider a 5/55 drawing:
1+2+3+4+5=15
51+52+53+54+55=265
Studies suggest that the “70 Percent Range” for 5/55 includes sets of numbers that add up to sums between 104 and 176.

## ChatGPT Answer
To apply the "70 Percent Win" strategy to a 6/45 lottery (where 6 numbers are drawn from a range of 1 to 45), you need to calculate the range of sums that corresponds to the “70 Percent Most Probable Range of Sums” for this game, just as you did for the 5/55 lottery.

### Step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Find the lowest possible sum:**
   The lowest sum for 6 numbers in a 6/45 lottery is:
```console
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21
```

2. **Find the highest possible sum:**
   The highest sum for 6 numbers is:
   ```console
   40 + 41 + 42 + 43 + 44 + 45 = 255
   ```

3. **Estimate the 70 Percent Range:**
   For the 5/55 lottery, the “70 Percent Range” was defined as a portion of the total range (from the lowest to the highest sum) that most likely contains winning combinations. In that case, the sums ranged from 104 to 176, out of a total possible range of 15 to 265. The difference between these sums is:
   ```console
   265 - 15 = 250 (total range)
   ```
   The "70 Percent Range" was approximately 104 to 176, which covers:
   ```console
   176 - 104 = 72 (70 percent of the probable range)
   ```

   To apply the same approach to the 6/45 lottery:
   - The total range of sums is 255 - 21 = 234
   - We need to find the middle 70 percent of this range.

4. **Calculate the 70 Percent Range for 6/45:**
   - 70% of the total range is 0.70 x 234 = 163.8.
   - To find the “70 Percent Range,” estimate the lower and upper bounds:
     - Lower bound: ((234 - 163.8) / 2) + 21 => 58.1 + 21 &#8776; 79
     - Upper bound: 79 + 163.8 &#8776; 243

So, the “70 Percent Range” for a 6/45 lottery would likely be **sums between 79 and 243**.

### Conclusion:
To apply the “70 Percent Win” strategy to a 6/45 lottery, select combinations of numbers whose sum falls between **79 and 243**. This sum range is where 70% of the probable winning combinations would be according to this theory.


### Australian Saturday Lottery (range of 79 and 243)
Ensure that each set's sum falls within the calculated range of 79 and 243.
By following this strategy, you aim to select sets of numbers that statistically have a higher chance of falling within the "70 Percent Most Probable Range of Sums," thus potentially increasing your odds of winning in the lottery. Adjust the numbers as necessary based on the specific draw and your preferences.


## Odd and Even
Choose the closest to 50% Odd and 50% even
Never choose all ods or all even

### Saturday Lotto
Try select sequence that falls into the below:
3 odds and 3 even
2 odds and 4 even
4 odds and 2 even


## Most or least picked ???
The 4 most probable number to be picked + 2 extras
