## 70 Percent Win

“70 Percent Win” formula when adding up lotto numbers
make sure the sum of the numbers you play falls within the “70 Percent Most Probable Range of Sums.” 
Create a range with the lowest sum of all your lottery numbers as well as the highest sum, then choose combos of lottery numbers within that range. Consider a 5/55 drawing:
1+2+3+4+5=15
51+52+53+54+55=265
Studies suggest that the “70 Percent Range” for 5/55 includes sets of numbers that add up to sums between 104 and 176.

To apply the "70 Percent Win" strategy to a 6/45 lottery, where we need to select sets of numbers whose sums fall within the most probable range of sums (104 to 176), we can proceed as follows:

Understand the Range:

The range given is 104 to 176 for sums of 5 numbers in a 5/55 lottery.
For a 6/45 lottery, where we need to select 6 numbers, the sums will naturally be higher.
Calculate Expected Range for 6/45:

To find an approximate range for 6 numbers in a 6/45 lottery, we can adjust based on the total possible sum:
Lowest possible sum for 6 numbers: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21
Highest possible sum for 6 numbers: 40 + 41 + 42 + 43 + 44 + 45 = 255
Adjust for Probability:

Since we're interested in the "70 Percent Range," we should focus on the middle 70% of the total possible sums.
Calculate 70% of the total range (255 - 21 = 234):
70% of 234 = 0.7 * 234 = 163.8
Rounded to whole numbers, this gives us approximately 82 on each side of the median sum.
Determine the 70 Percent Range:

Median sum (middle of the range): (21 + 255) / 2 = 138
70 Percent Range: Approximately 138 ± 82
Lower bound: 138 - 82 = 56
Upper bound: 138 + 82 = 220
Selecting Sets of Numbers:

Choose sets of 6 numbers where the sum falls within the range of 56 to 220.
Example Sets:

Generate sets of 6 numbers that add up to sums within 56 to 220.
For instance, you could consider sets like:
Set 1: 1, 10, 20, 30, 40, 45 (sum = 146)
Set 2: 5, 15, 25, 35, 42, 48 (sum = 170)
Set 3: 8, 18, 28, 38, 41, 48 (sum = 181)
Set 4: 3, 13, 23, 33, 43, 45 (sum = 160)
Set 5: 2, 12, 22, 32, 42, 44 (sum = 154)
Set 6: 7, 17, 27, 37, 47, 45 (sum = 180)
Verification:

### Australian Saturday Lottery (range of 56 to 220)
Ensure that each set's sum falls within the calculated range of 56 to 220.
By following this strategy, you aim to select sets of numbers that statistically have a higher chance of falling within the "70 Percent Most Probable Range of Sums," thus potentially increasing your odds of winning in the lottery. Adjust the numbers as necessary based on the specific draw and your preferences.


## Odd and Even
Choose the closest to 50% Odd and 50% even
Never choose all ods or all even

### Saturday Lotto
Try select sequence that falls into the below:
3 odds and 3 even
2 odds and 4 even
4 odds and 2 even


## Most or least picked ???
The 4 most probable number to be picked + 2 extras
